# Logo Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Add Your Logo File

1. Place your logo file in the `public` folder:
   ```
   public/logo.png
   ```
   OR
   ```
   public/logo.svg
   ```

2. **Recommended formats:**
   - **SVG** (best for scalability) - `logo.svg`
   - **PNG** (with transparent background) - `logo.png`
   - **WebP** (optimized) - `logo.webp`

3. **Recommended sizes:**
   - **Header logo**: 150-200px width (height will auto-adjust)
   - **Footer logo**: 120-150px width
   - **Favicon**: 32x32px or 64x64px (optional)

## Step 2: Logo File Naming

The code is set up to look for:
- `logo.png` (primary)
- `logo.svg` (if you prefer SVG)
- `logo.webp` (if you prefer WebP)

If your logo has a different name, you can:
1. Rename it to `logo.png` (or `.svg` / `.webp`)
2. OR update the logo path in the components (I can help with this)

## Step 3: Logo Placement

Your logo will appear in:
- ✅ Header (top navigation)
- ✅ Footer
- ✅ Mobile menu
- ✅ Admin panel (if you want)

## Step 4: After Adding Your Logo

Once you've placed your logo file in the `public` folder, the website will automatically use it!

The logo will:
- Scale properly on all devices
- Have smooth hover animations
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Work with the dark theme
